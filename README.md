# High-School-Biology---Population-Simulations
Designed for a high school's engineering-based AP Biology course, this simulation describes exponential and logistic growth, boom and bust cycles of populations, and trophic cascades.

This activity takes around 30-45 minutes to run and is completed individually alongside the attached packet. It is geared towards AP Biology students, ideally with some competence in Python but does not require any knowledge of it. Some modeling of setup and using the documents may be required. This activity works well towards the end of a unit on ecology, after having discussed the topics of growth curves, food webs, and keystone species.

AP_Biology_Population_Simulations.ipynb is the primary code file for this activity and is to be completed alongside the handout ("Population Simulations Handout").
